    <header><h2>Music</h2></header>
   <p> I find music to be one the things that can most quickly affect my mood. Here are a few different types of music that I like to listen to depending on what I need in that moment. I keep playlists of these types of music on Youtube and one my phone for easy access when I want to listen.</p>
     <h3>Thankful</h3>
    <p>I find this one to be preventative. Listening to people sing about how thankful they are for what they have inspires me. I say pair with dancing like a fool for maximum impact</p>
    <p> I find Soca to be a genre that has so much of this. I'm loving <a href="https://youtu.be/9nV8_5SZFrI" target="_blank">this song</a> and this one and this one right now</p>
    <h3>Sassy</h3>
    <p>When I really just need to say "No way. I'm rising above X", it can help to channel a bit of rebellion</p>
    <h3>Calming</h3>
    <p>This is especially helpful if I'm feeling anxious.</p>
    
    <h3>Silly</h3>
    <p> Sometimes you just need a laugh. For a funny story told in song, calypso's got some good ones. </p>

    <h3> Combining</h3>
    <p>Sometimes thing don't work like you'd hoped. Combining a few nice things can help</p>
    <pre><code>
      if(music!= help){
        try(music + movement);
      }
     </code></pre>
    <h3> Looking to the situation</h3>
    <p>The situation can also limit what can be done, but it's helpful to have a list of things that work for different situations</p>
    <pre><code>
      if (inPublic == true){
        try (breathe);
        try (playingPhone);
        try (peopleText);
      }
     </code></pre>
    
    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>I think learning can come through trying random lovely things and with time focusing on what seems to work best</p>
    <pre><code>
    var lovelyArray=["Movement", Music", "Play", "People", "Breathe"];
    var random= random*lovelyArray.length;
    try(lovelyArray[random]);
    </code></pre>
    <p>Becomes</p>
    <pre><code>
    try (lovelyArray[0]);
    </code></pre>
    
    
     <p></p>
    <pre><code>
